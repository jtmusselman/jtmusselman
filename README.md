### 👋 Hello there and welcome to my GitHub! I have a Codeberg account that you can visit [here](https://codeberg.org/musselman)
##### This account serves as a mirror for some of my projects from codeberg, and allows me to contribute to projects that are only found here!

🎉 Congratulations, you've stumbled upon my virtual playground where I code my dreams into reality!

👨‍💻 You'll find a mix of creative and innovative projects here, all of which I've poured my heart, soul, and a ton of tea into.

🤖 If you're into machine learning, usefull scripts, personal dotfiles, and side projects you're in the right place! But beware, there might be an occasional Terminator  or Star Wars reference here and there.

🤪 When I'm not busy programming, I like to do stand-up comedy (I'm still working on my first gig, but don't tell anyone), and binge-read books. 

🌎 World domination is always the penultimate goal, but for now, I'm focused on writing code that can at least help me rule over my digital world.

👀 Take a look at my projects, fork them, use them, or even make fun of them – your call!

📩 Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or suggestions. And if you're up for a joke or two, I'll be happy to oblige!
