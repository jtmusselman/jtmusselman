### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there and welcome to my GitHub! I have a Codeberg account that you can visit [here](https://codeberg.org/musselman)
This account serves as a mirror for some of my projects, and allows me to contribute to projects only found here.

### Most of the development I do can be found [here on my self-hosted git repository](https://git.privacyquest.net/musselman).
